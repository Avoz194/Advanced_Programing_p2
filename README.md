# Advanced_Programing_p2
A project as a part of my BSc CS studies - Advanced Programing Class.
Writen in Java and built as a Microservice framework, the project's goal is to simulate a Star-trek attack involving a few leading charachters.
Involves work with a few threads simulating the different Microservices, common resources and a MessageBus allowing to pass futures between the microservices.
